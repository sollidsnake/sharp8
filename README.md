# Chip 8 Emulator/Interpreter

This is a Chip 8 emulator I wrote to learn C#.

- You can set breaking (multiple) points using `-d` or `--debug-at-address`
- You can pause or resume the execution with F5. 
- You can use `-v` to show debug (PC, registers) information
- You can use `--ips` to set number of instructions per seccond
- Run the program with `--help` for more information
